# .claude/hooks/check-workflow-gates.sh
# PreToolUse hook for Bash: blocks commit/push/PR if quality gates aren't complete.
#
# Fires BEFORE Bash commands. Only activates when:
# 1. An active workflow exists in CONTINUITY.md (Command != none)
# 2. The command is git commit, git push, or gh pr create
# 3. Always-required quality gate checklist items aren't checked off
#
# Gated markers (canonical vocabulary — see rules/testing.md "Canonical E2E gate vocabulary"):
#   "Code review loop"  — code review must pass
#   "Simplified"        — code simplification must run
#   "Verified (tests"   — unit tests + lint + types + migrations must pass
#   "E2E verified"      — Phase 5.4 E2E must pass OR be explicitly N/A with reason
#
# Non-gated (conditional) items like "E2E use cases designed" and "E2E regression
# passed" stay advisory — the model decides if they apply. The E2E verified gate
# has an explicit N/A escape: `- [x] E2E verified — N/A: <reason>`.

# Evidence-based gate for E2E verified
#
# The checklist-only gate above is paperwork enforcement: a bad-faith actor
# can type '[x] E2E verified ...' without actually running the verify-e2e
# agent. This check binds the '[x] E2E verified' claim to a real filesystem
# artifact — a report file in tests/e2e/reports/ with mtime later than the
# branch-off point.
#
# Escape valve: the N/A form ('[x] E2E verified — N/A: <reason>') is trusted
# and skips the evidence check. Human reviewers catch lazy N/A justifications.
#
# Failure modes intentionally accepted:
#   - User on main (no branch) → can't compute merge-base → skip evidence
#   - No git / no main or master branch → skip evidence
#   - Report path writes fail → next commit-attempt catches it
